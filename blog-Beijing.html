                <br>
                <h2>Language</h2>

                <br>
                <h2>Visa</h2>
                     <p>
                        Nearly all foreign visitors to China need a visa. Visitors from Japan, Singapore and Brunei do not need to obtain a tourist visa before visiting China for a stay of up to 15 days.
                        <br>
                        <br>China visas can be obtained from Chinese embassies and consulates overseas or purchased through a registered travel agency, such as iVisa. Visa forms are often available for download from the Chinese embassies' websites. Both single and multi-entry visas for China are available.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Some Types of Visas
                        <br>
                        <ul class="unordered-list">
                            <li>Tourist Visa (L)</li>
                                <p>Issued to those who intend to go to China for touring and sightseeing. Proof of travel such as flight confirmation and hotel reservation are required. Single-entry, double-entry or multiple-entry are all available for tourists. The duration of stay (each visit) normally is 30-60 days. Multiple-entry up to 10 years is issued to US passport holder.</p>
                            <li>Business Visa (M)</li>
                                <p>Business M visa is issued to those who intend to go to China for commercial and trade activities. M Visa is usually issued for single-entry, double-entry or multiple-entry. M visa can be issued up to 10 years. The duration of stay (each visit) is normally 30-60 days based on particular Chinese Consulate.</p>
                            <li>Group Visa</li>
                                <p>Group Visa is a particular type of visa that issued to a tourist group which comprises at least five (5) members who must travel together in China. Group Visa is issued as a separate sheet instead of on the individual passport. One Official Visa Notification Letter from any head office of the China Travel Service (CTS), China International Travel Service (CITS), or China Youth Travel Service (CYTS), or Chinese National Tourism Bureau is required.</p>
                                
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Electric</h2>
                <p>A standard socket on a wall in China has two flat pins on the upper part and earthed three flat pins on the lower part. 
                    <br>All power sockets in Beijing provide a standard voltage of 220V with a standard frequency of 50Hz. You can use all your equipment in Beijing if the outlet voltage in your own country is between 220V-240V.
                </p>
                <br>
                  <h2>Timezone</h2>   
                     <p>China Standard Time (GMT+8)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="float-child">
                <h2>Best Time to Go</h2>
                    <p>The best times to visit Beijing are from March to May and from September to October. These temperate seasons provide the best climate, not to mention colorful scenery. In contrast, summer brings sweltering heat, and winter ushers in cold temps and sometimes snow. While you should be mindful of the weather, you should also steer clear of national public holidays. Millions of domestic tourists flood Beijing's historic and sacred sites. The surge pushes room rates through the roof.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Weather</h2>
                    <p>The climate is warm but windy in spring from April to May, hot in summer from June to August, pleasant and cool in autumn from September to October, and freezing cold in winter from November to mid-March of the next year. The hottest time is July and the coldest is January. </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Getting Around</h2>
                <p>
                    The best way to get around is by subway or taxi due to its convenience but remember to carry the name of the destination in Chinese characters to show taxi drivers. The local bus system is cheap and extremely extensive but tough to negotiate for non-Chinese speakers. Very few speak English but the subway is slick, modern, and easy to use. Information in English is available from the Beijing Government website. 
                    <ul class="unordered-list">
                        <li>Taxi</li>
                            <p>Taxis are plentiful, cheap and metered, and are usually just hailed from the street. Tipping is not expected.</p>
                        <li>Cars</li>
                            <p>Car rentals usually come with a driver. Avis (tel: +86 400 882 1119; http://www.avis.cn/) has an online booking service. Otherwise try one of the local taxi companies such as Beijing Beiqi Taxi (tel: +86 10 8766 5998, ext 8053), although you’ll need a Chinese speaker to help.</p>
                            <li>Bicycle</li>
                            <p>Bicycle rentals are a great option in Beijing. Almost all roads have bicycle lanes although cars don’t always keep out of them. You can hire bikes from many youth hostels and hotels.</p>

                    Forbidden City is an imperial palace complex at the heart of Beijing (Peking), China. The 178-acre (72-hectare) compound was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987 in recognition of its importance as the centre of Chinese power for five centuries, as well as for its unparalleled architecture and its current role as the Palace Museum of dynastic art and history.

                    The Summer Palace is the largest and best-preserved royal garden in China and also in the World. The Chinese call it Yihe Yuan, Garden of Restful Peace. The landscaped gardens, temples, and pavilions were designed to achieve harmony with nature and to please the eye.
